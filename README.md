# Assignment user-system
In this assignment you will create a user managememnt system.

The user interface was already created and can be run by executing the program. Your task is to create the underlying software for managing the users.

To do this, you will need to come up with a data structure that stores users, which consist of a username (`char *`), an e-mail (`char *`) and have an ID (`user_id` = `int`).

All the functions you need to implement are described in `user_system.h`. Implement them in `user_system.c`.
